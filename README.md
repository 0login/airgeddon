This is a multi-use bash script for Linux systems to audit wireless networks.<br/>
![We'll conquer the earth!!][1]

#Features
- Interface mode switcher (Monitor-Managed) keeping selection even on interface name changing.
- DoS over wireless networks using different methods.
- Assisted Handshake file capturing.
- Cleaning and optimizing Handshake captured files.
- Offline password decrypting on WPA/WPA2 captured files (dictionary, bruteforce and rule based).
- Evil Twin attacks (Rogue AP):
  - Only Rogue/Fake AP version to sniff using external sniffer (Hostapd + DHCP + DoS).
  - Simple integrated sniffing (Hostapd + DHCP + DoS + ettercap).
  - Integrated sniffing, sslstrip (Hostapd + DHCP + DoS + Ettercap + Sslstrip).
  - Integrated sniffing, sslstrip2 and BeEF browser exploitation framework (Hostapd + DHCP + DoS + Bettercap + BeEF).
  - Captive portal with "DNS blackhole" to capture wifi passwords (Hostapd + DHCP + DoS + Dnsspoff + Lighttpd).
- WPS features:
  - WPS scanning (wash). Self parameterization to avoid "bad fcs" problem.
  - Custom PIN association (bully and reaver).
  - Pixie Dust attacks (bully and reaver).
  - Bruteforce PIN attacks (bully and reaver).
  - Parameterizable timeouts.
  - Known WPS PINs attack (bully and reaver), based on online PIN database with auto-update.
  - Integration of the most common PIN generation algorithms.
- Compatibility with many Linux distros (see requirements section).
- Easy targeting and selection in every section.
- Drag and drop files on console window for entering file paths.
- Dynamic screen resolution detection and windows auto-sizing for optimal viewing.
- Controlled Exit. Cleaning tasks and temp files. Option to keep monitor mode if desired.
- Multilanguage support and autodetect OS language feature (see supported languages section).
- Help hints in every zone/menu for easy use.
- Auto-update. Script checks for newer version if possible.

Airgeddon is already included in some Linux distros and repositories:
 - <a href="http://www.wifislax.com">Wifislax</a> 4.12, 64-1.0 or higher.
 - <a href="https://blackarch.org">BlackArch</a> first 2017 release or later.
 - <a href="https://archstrike.org/wiki">ArchStrike</a> repository.

Anyway, can be used with any Linux distro if you have installed the tools what script needs. The script checks for them at the beginning.<br/>

We will enumerate the categories and tools. The format will be: "command -> possible package name". The command can be included in different packages depending of the distro.<br/>

Essential tools: <- *the script doesn't work if you don't have installed all of them*
```
ifconfig -> net-tools
iwconfig -> wireless-tools
iw -> iw
awk -> awk / gawk
airmon-ng -> aircrack-ng
airodump-ng -> aircrack-ng
aircrack-ng -> aircrack-ng
xterm -> xterm
```
Optional tools: <- *not necessary to work, only needed for some features*
```
wpaclean -> aircrack-ng
crunch -> crunch
aireplay-ng -> aircrack-ng
mdk3 -> mdk3
hashcat -> hashcat
hostapd -> hostapd
dhcpd -> isc-dhcp-server / dhcp-server / dhcp
iptables -> iptables
ettercap -> ettercap / ettercap-text-only / ettercap-graphical
etterlog -> ettercap / ettercap-text-only / ettercap-graphical
sslstrip -> sslstrip
lighttpd -> lighttpd
dnsspoof -> dsniff
wash -> reaver
reaver -> reaver
bully -> bully
pixiewps -> pixiewps
unbuffer -> expect
bettercap -> bettercap
beef -> beef / beef-xss
```
Update tools: <- *not necessary to work, only used for auto-update*<br/>
```
curl -> curl
```
Internal tools: <- *these are internally checked. Not necessary to work, good to have*<br/>
```
xdpyinfo -> x11-utils / xdpyinfo / xorg-xdpyinfo
ethtool -> ethtool
lspci -> pciutils
rfkill -> rfkill
```
Is highly recommended to have the internal tools installed. They improve functionality and performance. For example, xdpyinfo allow the script to detect the desktop resolution in order to print windows in a better way.

#Known incompatibilities
Impossible compatibility for Mac OSX at the moment. Some reasons:<br/>
*-Bash version* <- it can be avoided upgrading to 4 or later, this is not the real problem :smile:<br/>
*-Aircrack suite* <- this suite for OSX doesn't support airodump and aireplay<br/>
*-Wireless tools* <- iwconfig doesn't exists for OSX, and airport command can't be used. It generates very different outputs<br/>

Incompatible with OpenBSD and FreeBSD. They are Unix systems but they have some differences with Linux:<br/>
*-Bash* <- They have no bash. It can be installed, this is not the real problem again :sweat_smile:<br/>
*-Wireless tools* <- iwconfig doesn't exists for these systems, they use ifconfig instead and it generates very different outputs

#Disclaimer
This script must be used only for educational purposes and pentesting.<br/>
Use it only on your own networks.<br/>
We are not responsible of its use.<br/>
This script is under GPLv3 (or later) License.

#Use
Must be launched only using bash (not sh). Example `bash /path/to/airgeddon.sh`<br/>
If you launch the script using sh and a *"Syntax error"* appears, launch it with **bash instead of sh**. Even with no initial error, maybe you'll have it later. Use bash always!

#Supported Languages
English, Spanish, French, Catalan, Portuguese, Russian and Greek.

#Project Collaboration
You can join the project:<br/>
-Translations to other languages are welcome.<br/>
-More distros support compatibility.<br/>
-New features.<br/>
-Testing and feedback is needed too.<br/>

*For collaborating translators:*<br/>
You can take the strings to translate from the code or you can ask me directly by mail. I'll inform you how to proceed or to add you as a collaborator on github.<br/>

*For collaborating developers:*<br/>
Debug mode was implemented for faster development skipping intro and initial checks. Use it setting var *"debug_mode"* to 1<br/>
Please, respect the tab indentation, code style and the UTF-8 files format only using at the end of the lines LF (not CRLF).<br/>
Airgeddon code is 100% clean of warnings. Use <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck">shellcheck</a> to search for errors and warnings on code. <- Thanks xtonousou for the tip :wink:<br/>

*For beta testers:*<br/>
You can download the master version or the beta testing version from the development branch called `dev`
